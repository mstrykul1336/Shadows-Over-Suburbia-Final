**12/8/24 What was done**
- Fixed the sizing of all the tutorial canvases to make sure the UI fit the screen size.
- Added more to the tutorial about being able to attack at night too.
- Changed the main menu character selection camera to orthographic.
- Changed the heart container's horizontal group to fix UI stretching issues.
- Added an attack ability for all roles to add more challenge and speed to the game.
- Took out the knife object because it is no longer needed now that everyone can attack.
- Fixed attacking so it didn't call the RPC for the attack on every client, making you take more damage than you should. Now poison and attack should do their proper damage.
- Created descriptions for each character and made a character reference sheet to go into the game's portfolio page.
- **To Do from last week**
- As a player, I want the heart container UI fixed so it doesn't stretch and affect the gameplay aesthetic. 
- As a player that likes challenges, I want to have more options for attacking in the game so the game goes faster. 
- As a player that likes lore, I want to have a section dedicated to the lore of each character so I can roleplay more. 
- As a player that may break the game, I want there to be functions in the voting to keep going even if all players haven't voted yet. 
- As a player that likes nice UI, I want the tutorial to be the same size as the rest of the canvas UI. 
- As a player that likes variety, I want to be able to have more abilities so the game is more engaging and has many ways to play it. 
- As a player that likes neat UI, I want the character models to correctly show up in the character selection screen so I know what I'm picking.
